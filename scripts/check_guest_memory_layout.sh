# check_guest_memory_layout.sh — verify the built guest's RAM layout is the one
# we intend to prove.
#
# The guest's heap arena is a LINK-TIME constant: `riscv_common`'s link.x
# `PROVIDE(_heap_size = 768M)`, overridden in guest/.cargo/config.toml with
# `-C link-arg=--defsym=_heap_size=<bytes>`. The arena is baked into app.bin and
# therefore into both verification keys, so a guest built with an unintended one
# is a guest no registered VK accepts. Drift paths this catches:
#
#   * a rustflags list RE-AUTHORED without the `--defsym` — a Dockerfile, a CI
#     matrix, a downstream build, or a re-scaffold. This is the concrete one:
#     `cargo airbender new` emits a guest .cargo/config.toml carrying
#     `-Tmemory.x`/`-Tlink.x` but NO `--defsym`, so a config reconciled against
#     that template links fine and silently falls back to 768 MiB;
#   * an upstream `PROVIDE(_heap_size = ...)` change at the next airbender bump;
#   * a change in `--defsym`-vs-`PROVIDE` precedence in a new toolchain;
#   * `.rodata`/`.bss` growth pushing `_sheap` off its expected 2 MiB slot.
#
# (A whole-array RUSTFLAGS override is NOT one of them: it drops `-Tmemory.x`
# / `-Tlink.x` and the getrandom cfg with the `--defsym`, so the build fails
# loudly rather than silently reverting. The reachable shape is always a list
# that KEEPS the linker scripts and loses only the `--defsym`.)
#
# The machine's address space is 1 GiB (`riscv_transpiler`'s `jit::RAM_SIZE`;
# airbender-host defaults `ram_bound` to the same `1 << 30`), and the simulator
# indexes that array with `get_unchecked` behind a `debug_assert` only — so
# `_eheap` above the RAM top would be an out-of-bounds host access in a release
# prover, not a clean error. Hence the explicit ceiling assert here as well.
#
# Usage:
#   check_guest_memory_layout.sh <app.elf> [--expect-heap-mib N]
#                               [--ram-top-mib N] [--nm PATH]
#
#   --expect-heap-mib N   require `_eheap - _sheap` to be exactly N MiB.
#                         Omit to report the layout without pinning a size.
#   --ram-top-mib N       top of the RAM region in MiB (default 1024 = the
#                         Airbender machine's address space: memory.x ROM 4M +
#                         RAM 1020M). Only change this alongside an upstream
#                         memory.x / RAM_SIZE change.
#   --nm PATH             llvm-nm to use (default: the guest toolchain's).
