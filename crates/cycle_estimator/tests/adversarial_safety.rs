//! Adversarial safety regression: no attacker-controlled batch is ever both judged
//! trustworthy by the gate AND materially under-predicted.
//!
//! ## The fixture is a build product
//!
//! Every row is a **single-axis synthetic batch from the isolation corpus**
//! (`testdata/era_mainnet_batches/binary/9001xx` plus the precompile and decommit
//! families), measured on the CURRENT guest under the CURRENT feature schema, and
//! rebuilt by `scripts/cycle_model/build_fixtures.py` from a
//! `cycle_bench` run plus `testdata/cycle_model/isolation_manifest.json`.
//! Re-measuring after a guest change is therefore a CI job, not an expedition to a
//! local era node.
//!
//! Rows carry their `delegations` counts, so a revision of `DELEGATION_WEIGHTS` can
//! RE-SCALE these actuals instead of invalidating them. The fixture this replaced
//! stored only `effective_cycles`, which is why a delegation-weight sensitivity
//! sweep once compared a re-weighted model against a w=16 actual and produced
//! margins that did not mean what they appeared to.
//!
//! ## What replaced the arithmetic-share guard, and why that is an upgrade
//!
//! The predecessor of this test documented at length that its arithmetic rows were
//! *rejected rather than covered*, by a guard on the arithmetic share of the batch
//! with a 0.315 trip point. That guard is gone. It was an ad-hoc heuristic on a
//! ratio, it fired on every pure-arithmetic batch including ones the model priced to
//! within 7%, and its own comment conceded that the thing it actually protected —
//! frame churn / pooled-stack clearing, then 36.5x under-predicted per iteration —
//! was covered only *incidentally*, via the cheap arithmetic that attack happens to
//! run.
//!
//! What covers those batches now is one uniform rule: every rate declares the
//! largest count it was calibrated over, and a batch outside any of those domains is
//! declined (`CostTable::extrapolating`). That is strictly better because it is
//! per-axis and derived rather than global and tuned — and it covers frame churn
//! *directly* rather than by luck. Reaching the 2^36 proving ceiling at ~41k
//! effective cycles per churn iteration takes ~1.68M iterations, while
//! `near_call_count` leaves its calibrated domain at ~314k (174,463 observed x the
//! 1.8 slack). The gate declines the batch with 5.3x to spare, and it does so
//! because the batch is genuinely outside anything measured, not because a ratio
//! crossed a threshold.
//!
//! So unlike its predecessor, this test no longer has rows that are "rejected for
//! nothing": a rejection here means the batch is outside the calibrated domain,
//! which is a statement about the table's evidence rather than about the batch's
//! shape.
//!
//! ## What the exemption below does and does not claim
//!
//! A distrusted batch is allowed to under-predict here, on the theory that a consumer
//! refuses it. That is a claim about the ESTIMATOR, not about the sequencer: the deployed
//! consumer (`CyclesCriterion` in zksync-era) answers distrust with `IncludeAndSeal`,
//! which admits the transaction and then seals. Tightening this needs the consumer to
//! refuse a distrusted estimate, which is outside this crate — which is why the load-
//! bearing assertion below is the trust-INDEPENDENT one.

    // ## Why the assertion above is not the real bar
    //
    // `!trustworthy || covered` is vacuous whenever nothing is trustworthy, and that is
    // a real hazard here: these are single-axis floods, so many of them sit outside a
    // calibrated domain by construction — which is the protection working, not a defect.
    // At the time of writing 18 of the 32 rows are trusted and 14 declined.
    //
    // The split is worth watching rather than asserting. It briefly became 30/30 trusted
    // when domains were widened using the isolation corpus itself: the fixtures then fell
    // inside their own families' domains and the domain half of this test could no longer
    // fire at all. Domains now come from organic traffic (see build_cost_table.py), which
    // is what keeps that from recurring.
    //
    // An earlier version of this test tried to require that some rows be trusted, to
    // stop the invariant going vacuous. That was backwards — it demanded the domain
    // check fail to fire on exactly the batches it exists to catch. The honest fix is
    // to assert something strictly STRONGER that does not depend on trust at all:
    // every adversarial batch is covered, whether the gate trusts it or not.
    //
    // That is a real claim and it currently holds for all 32 rows, so the safety of
    // this fixture does not rest on the gate declining anything. It also means a
    // regression shows up here as an under-prediction rather than as a silently
    // vacuous pass.
